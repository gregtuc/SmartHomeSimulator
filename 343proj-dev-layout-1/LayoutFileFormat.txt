0: List of rooms (string of ints between 1 and 16, separated by single spaces)
{
1: Room number (single integer)
2: Features (string of ints between 1 and 32, separated by single spaces)
// A "feature" represents either a window or a door.
// If we are on room 1, and we say that rooms 2 + 5 + 32 have features,
// then there is a door between 1 and 2, as well as 1 and 5.
// There is also a window between 1 and 32, since the two cells are not linked by an edge.
// If there isn't a feature between two rooms with an edge, there is just a wall.
3: Number of lights (single integer)
4: Room's temperature (single double)
5: Doors to the outside (string of ints between 1 and 32, separated by single spaces)
}

Repeat above for each room (1 through 16 possibly)
